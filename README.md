# Trajectory Optimization for Kinova: Comparative Study of Various Approaches

This repository contains the implementation of trajectory optimization techniques for the Kinova robotic arm. We aim to explore, compare, and analyze different optimization methods to identify the most efficient and effective approach for trajectory planning.

## Overview

Trajectory optimization is a critical task in robotics for planning smooth, safe, and efficient paths for robotic arms. This project compares several optimization techniques applied to Kinova robots, with a focus on performance, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

## Approaches

The following trajectory optimization methods are implemented and compared in this project:

1. **Direct Collocation**  
   This method uses a direct transcription approach for optimizing the trajectory by converting the continuous-time optimal control problem into a large-scale nonlinear programming problem.

2. **Spline-based Optimization**  
   This approach represents the trajectory as a set of splines and optimizes the control points to achieve desired performance metrics.

3. **Gradient-based Optimization**  
   A local optimization technique that leverages gradient descent methods to fine-tune the trajectory for a smooth path.

4. **Sampling-based Optimization (RRT, PRM)**  
   Sampling-based techniques like Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) are also implemented for comparison.

5. **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**  
   This method uses a receding horizon approach to continuously optimize the trajectory during motion.
